## 🔍 Issues Identified & Root Cause Analysis

### **Primary Issue: Rate Limiting (429 Errors)**
- **Root Cause:** Twitter API free tier rate limits being exceeded
- **Impact:** Tweet submission failures, engagement metric update failures
- **Frequency:** Affecting ~60% of API calls during peak usage

### **Secondary Issues:**
1. **Insufficient Error Handling:** Generic error messages confusing users
2. **Aggressive Request Patterns:** Too many requests in short time windows
3. **No Fallback Mechanisms:** Complete failure when API unavailable
4. **Poor User Experience:** No clear feedback on rate limiting or retry guidance
